# Lok Sabha 2024 elections

This repository contains the data analysis and visualization project for the Lok Sabha 2024 elections in India. The project leverages various data analytics and visualization tools to analyze and present insights from the election data.

## Overview

The project includes the following key aspects:

- **Power BI**: Utilized for interactive data visualization and business intelligence, creating charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards to present insights.
- **Seaborn and Pandas**: Used for data preprocessing and analysis, uncovering trends and correlations in the election data.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Employed for sentiment analysis on political speeches and manifestos, gauging the public sentiment towards different parties.
- **Logistic Regression**: Developed a predictive model to forecast the winning party in each region based on historical data, demographic factors, and sentiment analysis.
